# A widget for the Awesome Window Manager 4.x to control the volume

A widget for the Awesome Window Manager (version 4.x) that
uses [pulseaudio_dbus](https://github.com/stefano-m/lua-pulseaudio_dbus) to
control your audio devices.

# Requirements

In addition to the requirements listed in the `rockspec` file, you will need
the [Awesome Window Manager](https://awesomewm.org) *version 4.x* and
PulseAudio with DBus enabled.

To enable DBus in PulseAudio, ensure that the line

    load-module module-dbus-protocol

is present in `/etc/pulse/default.pa` or `~/.config/pulse/default.pa`

# Installation

The easiest way to install this widget is to use `luarocks`:

    luarocks install pulseaudio_widget

You can use the `--local` option if you don't want or can't install
it system-wide

This will ensure that all its dependencies are installed.

Note that if you install with `--local` you will have to make sure that the
`LUA_PATH` environment variable includes the local luarocks path. This can be
achieved by `eval`ing the command `luarocks path --bin` **before** Awesome is
started.

For example, if you start Awesome from the Linux console (e.g. `xinit
awesome`) and you use `zsh`, you can add the following lines to your
`~/.zprofile`:

``` shell
if (( $+commands[luarocks] )); then
    eval `luarocks path --bin`
fi
```

If you use `bash`, you can add the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile`:

``` shell
if [[ -n "`which luarocks 2>/dev/null`" ]]; then
    eval `luarocks path --bin`
fi
```

If you use
an [X Display Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_manager) you will
need to do what explained above in your `~/.xprofile` or `~/.xinitrc`. See the
documentation of your display manager of choice for more information.

# Configuration

The widget will display the audio icons defined in your GTK+ theme and it will
resize them to fit in the available space. This means that you can switch your
icon theme, for example using `lxappearance`, and update the widget by
restarting AwesomeWM.

Specifically, you will need icons named:

* `audio-volume-high-symbolic`
* `audio-volume-medium-symbolic`
* `audio-volume-low-symbolic`
* `audio-volume-muted-symbolic`

# Mouse controls

When the widget is focused:

* Scroll: controls the volume
* Left button: toggles mute
* Right button: launches mixer (`mixer` field of the widget table, defaults to
  `pavucontrol`)

# Usage

Add the following to your `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua`:

Require the module:

``` lua
-- require *after* `beautiful.init` or the theme will be inconsistent!
local pulse = require("pulseaudio_widget")

-- Optionally, change the notification timeout default of 1 second to 5.
pulse.notification_timeout_seconds = 5
```

Add the widget to your layout:

``` lua
s.mywibox:setup {
  layout = wibox.layout.align.horizontal,
  { -- Left widgets },
  s.mytasklist, -- Middle widget
  { -- Right widgets
    pulse
  }
}
```

Finally add some keyboard shortcuts to control the volume:

``` lua
awful.util.table.join(
  -- Audio
  awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume", pulse.volume_up),
  awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioLowerVolume", pulse.volume_down),
  awful.key({ }, "XF86AudioMute",  pulse.toggle_muted),
  -- Microphone
  awful.key({"Shift"}, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume", pulse.volume_up_mic),
  awful.key({"Shift"}, "XF86AudioLowerVolume", pulse.volume_down_mic),
  awful.key({ }, "XF86MicMute",  pulse.toggle_muted_mic)
)
```
